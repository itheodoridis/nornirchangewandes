Python links:

If you are looking for a place to start with python, take a look at the following:

- this course was free for a period of time, sponsored and advertized by David Bombal (he is available on twitter and has a youtube channel): https://www.udemy.com/python-everything-you-need-to-know-to-become-a-software-developer/ . It's not free anymore but it can help you get started. 
- There are a lot of good books out there, but I'm not the one to tell you which is best for you. David Bombal once put out on twitter the list of books he recommends: https://twitter.com/davidbombal/status/1059155928212275202?s=09 
- This course was also almost free for a period of time: https://academy.gns3.com/p/python-network-programming
- You can find a lot of python content on the web, like this site: https://realpython.com/
- or this site: https://talkpython.fm/ (podcasts) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKPSmMfDsXTKrCZApukcJ7A (youtube channel)
- AND YOU CAN ALSO CHECK THIS ONE OUT!! : https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/programming-fundamentals (YES CISCO IS TEACHING YOU PYTHON!)

I am sure you can find plenty more on your own. But the best thing you can do is look for communities and mentors. The internet is a classroom in our time. Get out there and learn!
